Hello！

I am a master student at [Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT)](https://www.bit.edu.cn/) as well as [Key Laboratory of Brain Health Intelligent Evaluation and Intervention, Ministry of Education, P.R. China](https://bhe-lab.org/). My research interest includes federated learning for medical applications. I am very fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Kun Qian (钱昆)](https://eecsqian.com/). 

I’m looking forward to collaborating with you.
