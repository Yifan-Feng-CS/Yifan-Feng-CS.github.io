Hello！

I'm a fourth year undergraduate student from [School of Computer Science and Technology](https://it.xju.edu.cn/), [Xinjiang University (XJU)](https://www.xju.edu.cn/). My research interest includes federated learning for medical applications and brain-inspired computer audition. 

Starting in Sep 2024, I will be a master student at [Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT)](https://www.bit.edu.cn/) as well as [Key Laboratory of Brain Health Intelligent Evaluation and Intervention, Ministry of Education (BIT), P.R. China](https://bhe-lab.org/). I am very fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Kun Qian (钱昆)](https://eecsqian.com/). 

I’m looking forward to collaborating with you.
