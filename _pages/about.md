I'm a forth year undergraduate student from [School of Computer Science and Technology](https://it.xju.edu.cn/), [Xinjiang University](https://www.xju.edu.cn/). My research interest includes federated learning and brain inspired computer audition for medical applications. 

I will be a master student at [Key Laboratory of Brain Health Intelligent Evaluation and Intervention, Ministry of Education (Beijing Institute of Technology, BIT)](https://bhe-lab.org/) in 2024. I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Kun Qian](https://eecsqian.com/), BIT.
